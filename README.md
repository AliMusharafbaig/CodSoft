**Task 1**



This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. It utilizes the classic Titanic dataset, which contains information about individual passengers, such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and more
Key Steps:

Data Loading: The Titanic dataset is loaded from a CSV file.
Data Exploration: Initial data exploration is performed, including checking dimensions, missing values, and summary information.
Data Preprocessing: Missing values are handled by replacing them with mean values, and categorical columns (Sex, Embarked) are converted into numerical form.
Feature Selection: Irrelevant columns (PassengerId, Name, Ticket) are dropped, leaving relevant features for prediction.
Data Splitting: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function.
Model Training: A logistic regression model is initialized and trained using the training data.
Prediction: The trained model is used to predict survival outcomes on both the training and testing sets.
Accuracy Calculation: The accuracy of the model is calculated based on the predicted results.
Results Display: The training and testing accuracy scores are displayed to assess the model's performance.


**Very Important steps below as code was created on Google Colab**

Usage Instructions:

Clone or download the repository.
Ensure the 'tested.csv' dataset file is in the same directory as the script.
Set up the necessary Python environment with required libraries.
Run the script to load, preprocess, train the model, and calculate accuracy.
View the accuracy scores on the console to evaluate model performance.

**Task 2 **
Introduction
This repository contains code for a machine learning project that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors. The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics.

Libraries Used
pandas
numpy
seaborn
matplotlib
scikit-learn
Data Files
movies.dat: Contains movie data including MovieIDs, MovieName, and Category (genre).
users.dat: Contains user data including UserID, Gender, Age, Occupation, and Zip-code.
ratings.dat: Contains movie rating data including UserID, MovieID, Ratings, and TimeStamp.
**Important***
Instructions:
Load the required libraries using import statements.
Read the data from the movies.dat, users.dat, and ratings.dat files using pd.read_csv().
Perform data analysis, preprocessing, and cleaning on the datasets:
Handle missing values using dropna() or imputation techniques.
Create meaningful features through feature engineering.
Encode categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Perform data visualization to gain insights into the data.
Prepare the data for modeling:
Combine the datasets into a single DataFrame using appropriate identifiers.
Drop unnecessary columns like 'TimeStamp', 'Zip-code', and 'Occupation'.
Further preprocess features like age and gender.
Split the data into features (X) and target (Y) variables.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split().
Choose a machine learning model (e.g., LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier) and initialize it.
Train the model on the training data using the fit() method.
Make predictions on the training data and evaluate accuracy using the accuracy_score() function.
Make predictions on the test data and evaluate accuracy.
Experiment with different strategies to improve accuracy.
